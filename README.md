## About

This is an example app showcasing double-entry accounting, specifically showing journal entries for organizations.

The frontend is a standard React SPA. There are two interchangeable backends, one implemented with Node and the other with Ruby on Rails. Run whichever backend you prefer, just change the baseUrl in `web/src/api.ts`.

There are setup instructions and TODOs in each respective app directory.
